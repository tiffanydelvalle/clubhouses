    <h1>NYC Mental Health Clubhouses At Risk After With Mayor's New Initiative</h1>

    <h2>Department of Health and Mental Hygiene’s proposal to invest $30 million into mental health clubhouses went into effect this November, but the intense demands of the contract create an uncertain future as some may be subject to closure.</h2>

<p>Under the new request for proposal, clubhouses are seeing an investment never seen before. Mayor Eric Adams and NYC Health Commissioner Dr. Ashwin Vasan are working toward expanding the reach of clubhouses to those in the city struggling with a mental illness. The terms of the investment are that clubhouses must retain the 5,000 current members citywide and engage 10,000 additional new members within two fiscal years.</p>

<p>Clubhouses are programs for adults with a serious mental illness that are a community offering support with other goals such as employment, education, and housing. The Department of Health and Mental Hygiene issues a request for proposal for Clubhouse programs to meet certain mandated contracts by June 2024, otherwise they might be subject to closure.
</p>

<p>The National Alliance of Mental Illness is advocating alongside clubhouse program directors and clubhouse members city-wide to encourage the Mayor and City Council that the new proposal's are creating difficulty to existing clubhouses.</p>

<p> Caitlin Garbo, a manager of public policy at the National Alliance on Mental Illness stated “New York City is implementing new requirements that would lead to the closure of its clubhouses and thousands of people with mental illness will lose their communities.”</p> 

<p>Kimberly Blair, a member of the National Alliance on Mental Illness is a peer with a mental health diagnosis and she is adamant about getting the news out there that this RFP is harming her community.</p>

<p>“Not only are you ripping away the stability being at a clubhouse but you are also deteriorating other care needs in this whole mental health continuum here in New York City,” said Blair. “It is retraumatizing individuals when the city is already addressing a mental health crisis.”</p>
